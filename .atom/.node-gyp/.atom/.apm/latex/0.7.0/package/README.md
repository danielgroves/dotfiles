# LaTeX package

A simple package for Atom that compiles LaTeX files by invoking latexmk.

## Installing
Use the Atom package manager and search for "latex", or run `apm install latex`
from the command line.

## Status
This package is in an **extreme alpha** state. Right now everything is very na√Øve,
there's no error handling, progress indicator, and so on.

Right now the package is hardcoded to typeset using pdfTeX. This will be
configurable in the near future.

## Usage
Invoke the `build` command by pressing the default keybind `ctrl-alt-b` while in
a .tex file.
